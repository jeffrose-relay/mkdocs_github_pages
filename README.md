## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv mkdocs
source mkdocs/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# create mkdocs project
mkdocs new .
```

## Documentation Process

For all new development, we add a ticket to the board for documentation (1-2 pts)
For all existing code which needs documentation, we start making a list on Confluence and add 1 ticket to the board per sprint (1-2 pts).

### Types of Documentation
Process -> Confluence Page
Code -> Readme (what it does and how to run it)

### Future State
Start using MkDocs
